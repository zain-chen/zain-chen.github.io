Class Notes
======
* There are my class [notes](..//assets/30100.pdf) of UChicago STAT 30100. I would strongly recommend this course because Prof. Gao taught very wellâ€”clear and full of passion.

Reading Group
======
* We organized a reading group on Martin J. Wainwright's *High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint* in 2024 summer. There are our [notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/150rBLTnvn3WGoSuKOI3rdJoq5UxuqEoz?usp=drive_link).

* The only contribution I made to the UChicago students is [slides template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/uchicago-beamer/gpcrpvqzvdfr).
